## Question

Which seems better for creating the elements of the app: JS alone or JS with React?

JS with React is much more concise and easier to write compared to JS alone. I believe it's easier to read as well - at least on a small scale. However, I dislike that there is no separation of concerns. Your CSS/HTML feels far more intermingled with your JS than it does in Angular. Perhaps I will feel differently once we move into JSX.
